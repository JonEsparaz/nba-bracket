This is the result of my Friday evening boredom. 

For years the Esparaz family NBA Playoff bracket has been done on an Excel spreadsheet.
Last year we upgraded to Google Sheets. This year I took things a step further.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3024](http://localhost:3024) to view it in the browser.

Port 3024 has been selected in memory of the late Kobe Bryant.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
